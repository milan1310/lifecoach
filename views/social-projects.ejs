    With this spirit to guide me, I have endeavoured to the best of my ability

              <p class="card-text mt-3 fs-4">
                As part of the UNEP’s ongoing project to educate youth about the
                negative impact of the use of plastics on our environment, we at the
                Art of Living, are in discussions with UNEP on how to help them
                scale this message and program across Government and Private Schools
                across India. This would impact millions of students. We similarly
                have the capacity to impact students in 150+ countries across the
                world. Our engagement with UNEP is still at its inception stage but
                our first discussions have been very positive and fruitful and we
                are excited to take this matter further and make a Global impact in
                an area which is critical to the survival of our planet. Children
                are the future of this world and educating them is critical to
                saving our planet. Informed children can become catalysts for change
                in their communities and even be instrumental in teaching and
                changing the behaviours of their parents.

          <p class="card-text mt-3 fs-4">
            In Indonesia, I started with my dear friend, Sofia Blake, wife of
            the US Ambassador and the Art of Living chapter, the 6x6 Women in
            Action Project where we worked with 6 grassroots Indonesian women to
            help them acquire the skills necessary to take their work to the
            next level. The most successful of these women, pioneered a project
            to recycle plastic, mainly on the island of Lombok. She brought
            livelihood to over 10,000 residents of Lombok through a simple but
            effective business model. The residents would bring plastic from all
            over Lombok, including beaches and streets. Febriarti would then
            separate the plastic into 70+ categories and then weigh and record
            quantities by weight of plastic brought by each individual. When she
            had about 2-3 tons she would ship it to a recycling plant. The plant
            would pay her by the kilo and she would then distribute the money
            among the people who had collected the plastic. We supported her by
            getting recognition from the Government and hence access to some
            funding. We also supported her in applying for and participating in
            the “Sankalp Award” for the most promising social enterprise. It was
            because of our efforts in supporting her in crafting the submission
            that she was able to win the first prize. She won USD 10,000 and
            this transformed her life. Today she travels the whole world and
            lectures on environmental issues.

            In a combined project of the Indian Embassy, the Barefoot College

            implemented in the remotest parts of Indonesia in Flores...bringing
